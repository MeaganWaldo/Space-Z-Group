Overview:
This project is a text-based adventure game where you, the player, begin the journey in the sleeping quarters of a space station. A mysterious outbreak has occurred, and it is your task to find out what has happened. The gameplay is conversation driven, and you may encounter some surprises as you explore.

Game Description:
During the exploration of the space station, the player can travel from room to room. In going to the rooms the player can meet NPC's, gather items, and encounter zombies to fight. The fights would be against zombies and it would be turn based. The player would be tasked to make their way throughout the space station into the space shuttle to escape, bringing any surviving NPCâ€™s along. 

Engine:

For making the game we are using TADS as an engine. 

Current Progress:
Demo 0 (10/4/2020)
So far we have created rooms for the space station, added some key cards for said rooms, and created a map for the space station.

Demo 1 (10/24/2020):
So far we have one NPC, the doctor. We have also added three objects: a sword, a medkit, and a zombie hand. For the doctor we added lines, responses, and knowledge was added to only allow players to access specific conversations if they know something about the zombie hand.
