1: Core features that need to be present <br />
As a gamer, I expect certain features to be present to ensure a quality game-playing experience.
1.1: Saving the game
As a gamer, I want to be able to save the progress of my game so that I don’t have to restart the game every time; just pick up where I left off.
Elaboration: Users should have the ability to save the progress that they have made in a game.
Constraints: Users can only save the game at check points and not at any point in the game that they want.
Effort Estimation: 4 person-hours
Acceptance Test: Perform a successful save on a currently running game then be able to reload the game at the last save point.
 
2: Replayability 
As an arcade owner, I want a game that has high replayability so that my customers will come back to it again and again.
2.1: Making sure the customers come back
As an arcade owner, I want the customers to want to come back to play the game multiple times to maximize profit.
Elaboration: Users should have a reason to come back and play the game again because it offers a challenge and a slightly different outcome each play.
Constraints: There will only be a certain number of randomly generated paths that a user can uncover.
Effort Estimation: 85 person-hours
Acceptance Test: Test the game multiple times to ensure that random events are working and that the game is not exactly the same during each play session.
 
3: Captivating storyline
As a graphic novel author, I want to play a game that is unique enough to inspire my creativity.
3.1: A storyline that keeps the player engaged and interested
Elaboration: Users should be kept interested in the storyline so that they continue to play the game.
Constraints: Zombie stories are overdone, and since all of the group members are not writers we could have holes in our plotline. 
Effort Estimation: 5 person-hours
Acceptance Test: Ask a writer to review the storyline and get general feedback regarding the plotline and any holes we may have not considered.
 
4: Approachability 
As an average individual, I want a game that I feel has a comfortable level of difficulty so that I enjoy myself while I play the game.
4.1 Clear Instructions

As an average individual, I want the game to give me concise instructions, to get a good idea of how to properly play the game.

Elaboration: The game should have clear instructions or a guide as to the type of instructions the system accepts so that the player does not become frustrated and drawn out of the adventure just trying to figure out commands.

Constraints: Ensure that the instructions are clear enough for the user to understand.

Effort Estimation: 2 person-hours

Acceptance Test: Have a gaming novice test the game to ensure that he or she can type in commands and have the system recognize variations.

5: Individuality
As a reviewer, I want a game that stands out among other text based games that I have reviewed so that I can provide a comprehensive review.
5.1 Aspects that set the game apart from other games
As a reviewer, I want a game that provides the user with something unique so that I can provide a comprehensive review that covers aspects of a game that I have never reviewed before.
Elaboration: The game should provide some aspect that makes it stand out to its users among the other many text based games that exist.

Constraints: The sheer number of zombie stories that exist can cause our game to seem clichéd.

Effort Estimation: 72 person-hours

Acceptance Test: Research other text-based games to see if anyone has already published zombie adventures and play the game to see how similar or how unique the storyline is.
 
6: Marketability
As a video game digital distribution service, I expect a game that is marketable to many different customers so that we can have multiple distributions of the game.
6.1 Wider Audience Appeal
As a video game digital distribution service, I expect a game that will appeal to a vast audience so that we can maximize sales of the game.
Elaboration: The game should be marketable to a large percentage of the customers that use the distribution service.

Constraints: The different tastes in games that each individual may have.

Effort Estimation: 7 person-hours

Acceptance Test: Gather statistics from gaming platforms to analyze the type of games that are popular on the platform to see whether platforms purchase/distribute text-based games and which platforms are popular for text-based game distributions.
