1: Core features that need to be present <br />
As a gamer, I expect certain features to be present to ensure a quality game-playing experience. <br /> 
1.1: Saving the game <br />
As a gamer, I want to be able to save the progress of my game so that I don’t have to restart the game every time; just pick up where I left off. <br /> 
Elaboration: Users should have the ability to save the progress that they have made in a game. <br /> 
Constraints: Users can only save the game at check points and not at any point in the game that they want. <br /> 
Effort Estimation: 4 person-hours <br /> 
Acceptance Test: Perform a successful save on a currently running game then be able to reload the game at the last save point. <br /> 
  <br /> 
2: Replayability  <br /> 
As an arcade owner, I want a game that has high replayability so that my customers will come back to it again and again. <br />
2.1: Making sure the customers come back <br />
As an arcade owner, I want the customers to want to come back to play the game multiple times to maximize profit. <br />
Elaboration: Users should have a reason to come back and play the game again because it offers a challenge and a slightly different outcome each play. <br />
Constraints: There will only be a certain number of randomly generated paths that a user can uncover. <br />
Effort Estimation: 25 person-hours <br />
Acceptance Test: Test the game multiple times to ensure that random events are working and that the game is not exactly the same during each play session. <br />
  <br />
3: Captivating storyline <br />
As a graphic novel author, I want to play a game that is unique enough to inspire my creativity. <br />
3.1: A storyline that keeps the player engaged and interested <br />
Elaboration: Users should be kept interested in the storyline so that they continue to play the game. <br />
Constraints: Zombie stories are overdone, and since all of the group members are not writers we could have holes in our plotline.  <br />
Effort Estimation: 5 person-hours <br />
Acceptance Test: Ask a writer to review the storyline and get general feedback regarding the plotline and any holes we may have not considered. <br />
  <br />
4: Approachability  <br />
As an average individual, I want a game that I feel has a comfortable level of difficulty so that I enjoy myself while I play the game. <br />
4.1 Clear Instructions <br />
As an average individual, I want the game to give me concise instructions, to get a good idea of how to properly play the game. <br /><br />
Elaboration: The game should have clear instructions or a guide as to the type of instructions the system accepts so that the player does not become frustrated and drawn out of the adventure just trying to figure out commands. <br />
Constraints: Ensure that the instructions are clear enough for the user to understand. <br />
Effort Estimation: 2 person-hours <br />
Acceptance Test: Have a gaming novice test the game to ensure that he or she can type in commands and have the system recognize variations. <br />
 <br />
5: Individuality <br />
As a reviewer, I want a game that stands out among other text based games that I have reviewed so that I can provide a comprehensive review. <br />
5.1 Aspects that set the game apart from other games <br />
As a reviewer, I want a game that provides the user with something unique so that I can provide a comprehensive review that covers aspects of a game that I have never reviewed before. <br />
Elaboration: The game should provide some aspect that makes it stand out to its users among the other many text based games that exist. <br />
Constraints: The sheer number of zombie stories that exist can cause our game to seem clichéd. <br />
Effort Estimation: 72 person-hours <br />
Acceptance Test: Research other text-based games to see if anyone has already published zombie adventures and play the game to see how similar or how unique the storyline is. <br />
<br />
6: Marketability <br />
As a video game digital distribution service, I expect a game that is marketable to many different customers so that we can have multiple distributions of the game. <br />
6.1 Wider Audience Appeal <br />
As a video game digital distribution service, I expect a game that will appeal to a vast audience so that we can maximize sales of the game. <br />
Elaboration: The game should be marketable to a large percentage of the customers that use the distribution service. <br />
Constraints: The different tastes in games that each individual may have. <br />
Effort Estimation: 7 person-hours <br />
Acceptance Test: Gather statistics from gaming platforms to analyze the type of games that are popular on the platform to see whether platforms purchase/distribute text-based games and which platforms are popular for text-based game distributions. <br />
<br />
7: Money Maker<br />
As an investor in the company I want the game to be able to make a lot of money so that I am able to make more money than what I invested initially.<br />
7.1 Investing Opportunities<br />
As an investor in the company I want the game to be able to make a lot of money so that I am able to make more money than what I invested initially. I want the company to grow and have a lot of money making opportunities. <br />
Elaboration: The game should be portable and marketable so that investors can have the opportunity to make more money.<br />
Constraints: The game may not make money due to different reasons such as target platforms, or marketability versus demand.<br />
Effort Estimation: 10 person-hours<br />
Acceptance Test: Do research on what other similar games have done that have done well in sales. We then choose an appropriate platform to distribute the game where it will have the broadest appeal. <br />
<br />
8: Age Appropriateness <br />
As a consumer I want the game to be age appropriate for who is buying it, so that I do not purchase something I do not want.<br />
8.1 ESRB Rating<br />
As a parent I want the game to be clearly defined for a certain age group, so I know what to buy for my children.<br />
Elaboration: The game should have a clearly defined intended audience (i.e rated E,T,M etc.) and should not be ambiguous, so those who care about age restrictions can know if its ok to buy.<br />
Constraints: Rating a text based game might be a bit harder than a traditional video game, due to lack of graphical feedback.<br />
Effort Estimation: 5 person-hours<br />
Acceptance Test: Show the game to various people of different backgrounds (like parents, adult gamers, ect.) asking them what age they believe the game to be appropriate for.<br />
<br />
9: Representation<br />
As an activist, I want to play a game that doesn’t promote stereotypes so that I can recommend it to others.<br />
9.1 Avoiding Common Stereotypes<br />
As an activist and avid gamer, I want to play a video game that doesn’t promote gender and race stereotypes as common tropes for entertainment so that I can feel good while playing the game and also feel good about recommending it to others.<br />
Elaboration: The story writers and developers should ensure that the game does not contain offensive stereotypes or gender bias. The game should be accessible to all without alienating players because they feel insulted by the portrayal of certain characters.<br />
Constraints: Not everyone recognizes that something they find funny may be offensive to another person, so the testing group has to be composed of a wider variety of people of different races and genders so that they can give an honest opinion regarding the storyline and characters. It may be hard for the group to put together such a testing audience.<br />
Effort Estimation: 6 person-hours<br />
Acceptance Test: A variety of people of different ages, genders, and racial groups play the game and don’t find it objectionable in regard to how characters are represented. They find the storyline engaging and the characters generic enough that their own imaginations fill in the details for the characters.<br />
<br />
10: Platform Diversity<br />
As a small town game store owner, I expect the game to be available on common platforms so that sales won't be limited due to the type of devices customers own.<br />
10.1: Available On Common Platforms<br />
As a small town game store owner, I want to be able to provide all my customers with the option to buy and play this game so having it available on multiple platforms will increase the number of customers buying it.<br />
Elaboration: The game should have the ability to be played on multiple platforms and with most of these platforms being commonly used ones.<br />
Constraints: We can not cater to every single platform out there. TADS also constrains us to use their interpreter so portability is not cross-platform.<br />
Effort Estimation: 10 person-hours<br />
Acceptance Test: Load and run the game successfully on a variety of platforms with focus being on very common platforms that a majority of individuals use.<br />
<br />
11: Average length of gameplay<br />
As a parent, I want to buy a game that will last a while before my children get bored and stop playing them. The last game purchased for them was only played for 3 days and has been on the shelf since.<br />
11.1 Attention maintenance<br />
As a parent, I want to know that the game I buy for them will keep them busy for a long time, so that I don’t have to spend so much money on games. 
Elaboration: It’s important for the game to have a way to keep my kids entertained and challenged. If the game is too easy, they beat it and move on quickly, which leads them to wanting another game soon after. The game should last long enough for the purchaser to feel like they got their money’s worth. <br />
Constraints: How long should a game last for it to be described as worth the cost of the game. The length of time varies from user to user. <br />
Effort Estimation: 6 person-hours<br />
Acceptance Test: Have game testers play the game to determine replayability and average game play time. <br />
