1: Core features that need to be present <br />
As a gamer, I expect certain features to be present to ensure a quality game-playing experience. <br /> 
1.1: Saving the game <br />
As a gamer, I want to be able to save the progress of my game so that I don’t have to restart the game every time; just pick up where I left off. <br /> 
Elaboration: Users should have the ability to save the progress that they have made in a game. <br /> 
Constraints: Users can only save the game at check points and not at any point in the game that they want. <br /> 
Effort Estimation: 4 person-hours <br /> 
Acceptance Test: Perform a successful save on a currently running game then be able to reload the game at the last save point. <br /> 
  <br /> 
2: Replayability  <br /> 
As an arcade owner, I want a game that has high replayability so that my customers will come back to it again and again. <br />
2.1: Making sure the customers come back <br />
As an arcade owner, I want the customers to want to come back to play the game multiple times to maximize profit. <br />
Elaboration: Users should have a reason to come back and play the game again because it offers a challenge and a slightly different outcome each play. <br />
Constraints: There will only be a certain number of randomly generated paths that a user can uncover. <br />
Effort Estimation: 85 person-hours <br />
Acceptance Test: Test the game multiple times to ensure that random events are working and that the game is not exactly the same during each play session. <br />
  <br />
3: Captivating storyline <br />
As a graphic novel author, I want to play a game that is unique enough to inspire my creativity. <br />
3.1: A storyline that keeps the player engaged and interested <br />
Elaboration: Users should be kept interested in the storyline so that they continue to play the game. <br />
Constraints: Zombie stories are overdone, and since all of the group members are not writers we could have holes in our plotline.  <br />
Effort Estimation: 5 person-hours <br />
Acceptance Test: Ask a writer to review the storyline and get general feedback regarding the plotline and any holes we may have not considered. <br />
  <br />
4: Approachability  <br />
As an average individual, I want a game that I feel has a comfortable level of difficulty so that I enjoy myself while I play the game. <br />
4.1 Clear Instructions <br />
As an average individual, I want the game to give me concise instructions, to get a good idea of how to properly play the game. <br />
Elaboration: The game should have clear instructions or a guide as to the type of instructions the system accepts so that the player does not become frustrated and drawn out of the adventure just trying to figure out commands. <br />
Constraints: Ensure that the instructions are clear enough for the user to understand. <br />
Effort Estimation: 2 person-hours <br />
Acceptance Test: Have a gaming novice test the game to ensure that he or she can type in commands and have the system recognize variations. <br />
 <br />
5: Individuality <br />
As a reviewer, I want a game that stands out among other text based games that I have reviewed so that I can provide a comprehensive review. <br />
5.1 Aspects that set the game apart from other games <br />
As a reviewer, I want a game that provides the user with something unique so that I can provide a comprehensive review that covers aspects of a game that I have never reviewed before. <br />
Elaboration: The game should provide some aspect that makes it stand out to its users among the other many text based games that exist. <br />

Constraints: The sheer number of zombie stories that exist can cause our game to seem clichéd. <br />

Effort Estimation: 72 person-hours <br />

Acceptance Test: Research other text-based games to see if anyone has already published zombie adventures and play the game to see how similar or how unique the storyline is. <br />
 
6: Marketability <br />
As a video game digital distribution service, I expect a game that is marketable to many different customers so that we can have multiple distributions of the game. <br />
6.1 Wider Audience Appeal <br />
As a video game digital distribution service, I expect a game that will appeal to a vast audience so that we can maximize sales of the game. <br />
Elaboration: The game should be marketable to a large percentage of the customers that use the distribution service. <br />

Constraints: The different tastes in games that each individual may have. <br />

Effort Estimation: 7 person-hours <br />

Acceptance Test: Gather statistics from gaming platforms to analyze the type of games that are popular on the platform to see whether platforms purchase/distribute text-based games and which platforms are popular for text-based game distributions. <br />
