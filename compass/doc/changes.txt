/*
 *   Version 1.
 */

   Initial release.

/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------- */
/*
 *   Version 2.
 */

   Added pluggable compass writers. Apart from the previous HTML compass, a
text-only compass is now included, which will be used on interpreters where
the HTML compass cannot be displayed. The extension should also be able to
cope with interpreters that can't display any compass at all.

   The placement of the compass banner has been made more configurable.

   The default HTML compass is now only a third as large as it used to be,
and is placed to the right of the status line.

   Moved the English-specific definitions to a separate file.

/*
 *   Version 3.
 */

   The COMPASS ON/OFF action is now a system action, which means that it
consumes no game time and can't be directed to other actors.

   The third (bottom) line of the text-only compass would disappear if there
were no southerly exits. This has been corrected.

   The tests used to determine which compass writers are supported by the
interpreter are now done more properly.

   A useless thumbnail file was removed from the archive.
