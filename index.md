Overview: This project is a text-based adventure game where you, the player, begin the journey in the sleeping quarters of a space station. A mysterious outbreak has occurred, and it is your task to find out what has happened. The gameplay is conversation driven, and you may encounter some surprises as you explore. During the exploration of the space station, the player can travel from room to room. In going to the rooms the player can meet NPC's, gather items, and encounter zombies to fight. The fights would be against zombies and it would be turn based. The player would be tasked to make their way throughout the space station into the space shuttle to escape, bringing any surviving NPCâ€™s along.
